Assembly Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove strings, lumps and bumps from 3D printed parts
Sand the inner and outer races so the faces contact with no visible gap.

Tap Holes
  Don't tap too deep, 3 to 4 threads is good.
  Tap sensor mounting holes (4) from gear side of input ring gear.
  Tap inner race mounting holes (8) from flat side of input ring gear.
  
Input Ring Gear Assy:
Glue sensors to sensor mount, be sure botton of slot is parallel to the bottom of the mount.
Thread #8-32 set screw into sun gear.
Attach sensor mount to input ring gear with #4-40 x 3/8" button head screws and flat washers.
Screw length issue: Drill thru the input ring gear into the sensor mount about 2mm or grind down the 3/4" screws.
Attach wheel mount and inner races to input ring gear w/ #4-40 x 3/4" socket head cap screws.
Route the sensor wires and glue in place with a dab of hot melt glue so they can't touch
 the planet gears or planet carrier.

Motor Mounting:
Test fit the motor to the input ring gear and remove.
Test fit the sun gear to the motor shaft and remove.
Place M4 screws in input ring gear, slide sun gear into place, push the motor part way
 and align the screws.
Working each screw a couple threads at a time, align the notch in the sun gear and use
 a T20 driver to tighten the motor screws.
Placing some card stock behind the sun gear may be useful as a spacer.  Motor should spin freely when done.

Tire Mounting:
Assemble the complete wheel, but only use 4 screws each in the inner rim and hub cap.
Work the tire over the wheel.
One side at a time remove the inner rim or hub cap.
Align the tire's beed in the inner rim and replace the inner rim or hub cap, with all 8 screws.
Gradually tighten the screws while holding the wheel tightly together.
